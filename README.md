# Global-Music

## Global Music is a multichain Web3 platform designed to revolutionize the music industry by addressing key challenges faced by artists and listeners. By leveraging blockchain technology across networks such as Polkadot, Ethereum, Stacks, and Bitcoin, Global Music offers a decentralized ecosystem where artists can mint their music as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and engage directly with their audience. Listeners are rewarded through an innovative Listen2Earn model, earning $Globe tokens for streaming music. This approach ensures transparent royalty distribution, empowers artists with greater control over their work, and fosters a more interactive and rewarding experience for fans.

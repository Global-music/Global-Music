# Global-Music

is a multichain Web3 platform designed to revolutionize the music industry by addressing key challenges faced by artists and listeners. By leveraging blockchain technology across networks such as Polkadot,Global Music offers a decentralized ecosystem where artists can mint their music as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and engage directly with their audience. Listeners are rewarded through an innovative Listen2Earn model, earning $Globe tokens for streaming music. This approach ensures transparent royalty distribution, empowers artists with greater control over their work, and fosters a more interactive and rewarding experience for fans.
